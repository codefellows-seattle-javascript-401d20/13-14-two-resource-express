This is day 13-14 of lab with Code Fellows. The purpose of the labs is to teach students how to utilize express and other various node modules to create rest-apis. Also added a second model with a one to many relationship.
### How to start server:
In a terminal, navigate to the lab-mark directory and install the required dependencies by typing `npm i`. Refer to the commands below to interact with the software.
* ##### Start the database: `npm run dbon`
* ##### Start the server: `npm run start`
* ##### Close the database: `npm run dboff`
### Making requests:
After the server has been turned on, different requests can be made to it. You can use any tool to accomplish this, we recommend POSTMAN or httpie.
